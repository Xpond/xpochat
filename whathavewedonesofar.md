  - **Landing Page (`/`)**: Public welcome page showcasing features
  - **Authentication Flow**: "Start Chatting" button leads to sign-in/sign-up
  - **Protected Chat Page (`/chat`)**: Authenticated users land here
  - **Redirect Logic**: Unauthenticated access to `/chat` redirects to `/sign-in`

#### 3. Visual Design & Three.js Background
- **Animated Particle Background**: Sophisticated Three.js particle system (`ThreeBackground.tsx`):
  - 150 animated particles with connecting lines when nearby (< 30 units distance)
  - Entropy simulation with gentle floating and random shifts
  - Scroll-responsive camera movement and scene rotation
  - Performance optimized with proper cleanup and memory management
- **Color Scheme**: Dark-to-teal gradient theme:
  - Background: Linear gradient from almost black (`#0a0a0a`) to dark teal (`#1a4a4a`)
  - Consistent color variables in CSS for maintainable theming
  - Semi-transparent containers with backdrop blur effects

#### 4. Clerk Authentication Customization
- **Custom Styling**: Completely customized Clerk components:
  - Semi-transparent cards (`rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.8)`) with backdrop blur
  - Teal gradient buttons matching overall theme
  - Custom form inputs with teal borders and focus states
  - Consistent typography and spacing across auth components

- `startStreaming()` / `appendStream()` / `finishStreaming()` - Live AI token streaming
- `getUserChats()` - User chat history and session management
- `getUserKey()` / `setUserKey()` - BYOK API key storage and retrieval
- `getUserMessageCount()` / `incrementUserMessageCount()` - Trial limit system

#### 10.1 Neon Postgres & Cloudinary Persistent Storage **(NEW – 2025-06-16)**
Added a durable persistence layer while preserving the reactive, in-memory philosophy:

- **Neon Serverless Postgres**
  - Lightweight driver `@neondatabase/serverless` with a 5 kB footprint.
  - Schema: `chats`, `messages`, and `attachments` tables (string PKs for chat/message IDs).
  - Automatic init in `backend/src/db/neon.ts` – runs on server start, drops mis-shaped tables and recreates the correct schema.
  - 24-hour migration: Bun script `scripts/migrate-to-neon.ts` promotes Dragonfly data to Neon; scheduled via cron every 5 min in production.

- **Cloudinary CDN Storage**
  - Client uploads directly to Cloudinary with a signed request; zero load on the server.
  - Backend `/api/upload` now pipes the temp file → Cloudinary → deletes local disk and writes metadata to Neon `attachments` in a single transaction.
  - Free 25 GB tier is enough for OSS demos; env vars make it swappable with any S3-compatible service.

- **Security & Ops**
  - All creds live in `.env` (`DATABASE_URL`, `CLOUDINARY_*`).
  - No binary data touches Postgres – only URLs and keys, keeping DB backups tiny.
  - Full RLS-ready: future policies can restrict `user_id` on every table.

This completes the hybrid storage vision: blazing-fast Dragonfly for the first 24 h, then cost-efficient, durable storage in Neon with Cloudinary-backed blobs.

`getUserApiKeys()` - Active API key enumeration for frontend

- **BYOK System**: Full configuration for OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Groq
- **Robust Validation**: Zod-based validation for all provider configurations

#### 14. Dynamic Provider Routing & Multi-Provider BYOK
**Date**: 2025-06-12 *(revised 2025-06-15)*
Complete refactor to support deterministic, user-controlled routing:
– **Explicit Provider Selection**: The *first* path segment of the model id now dictates the exact endpoint. Examples: `openrouter/google/gemini-1.5-flash` → OpenRouter, `google/gemini-1.5-flash` → Google. This choice is never overridden by which keys the user has saved.
– **OpenRouter Model IDs**: Every model fetched from OpenRouter is stored as `openrouter/<original-id>` so that picking a model under the "OpenRouter" group always routes through OpenRouter even if the underlying id begins with `openai/`, `google/`, etc.
– **Key Lookup Isolation**: The router only looks up the API key for the provider selected by the user (`dragonflydb.getUserKey(userId, provider)`). Extra keys for other providers are ignored, eliminating accidental fall-throughs.
– **Model Id Normalisation**: Before dispatching the request the router strips `openrouter/` (for OpenRouter calls) or the native provider prefix (for direct calls) to match each API's expectations.
– **Extensible Switch Statement**: Routing remains a simple `switch(provider)` with stubs for new providers, preserving future-proof extensibility.

Surgical decomposition of monolithic `app/chat/page.tsx` (~950 LOC) into focused components:

**New Component Map**:
1. **MessageList (`components/chat/MessageList.tsx`)**: Message rendering, markdown parsing, auto-scroll
2. **ChatInputArea (`components/chat/ChatInputArea.tsx`)**: Textarea, buttons, model selector, trial counter
3. **ChatHistoryPanel (`components/chat/ChatHistoryPanel.tsx`)**: Sliding left panel with chat list
4. **SettingsPanel (`components/chat/SettingsPanel.tsx`)**: Sliding right panel with BYOK management

**Benefits**:
- **Maintainability**: Each UI concern in 100-200 LOC file with clear interfaces
- **Reusability**: Provider-agnostic components for Storybook or mobile layouts
- **Performance Isolation**: Expensive effects scoped to components
- **Unit-Test Ready**: Decomposition aligns with test harness architecture

#### 26. Automated Test Suite & Continuous Verification
**Date**: 2025-06-13
**Status**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS

Codifying "everything must keep working" philosophy into single-command test harness:

**Core Principles**:
1. **Real Code, Real Runtime**: Backend boots exactly as production with random port
2. **Zero External Tooling-Tax**: All tests run under Bun's built-in runner
3. **Layered Confidence**: Fast smoke test, then deeper route/WebSocket/E2E coverage
4. **Determinism**: Clerk fallback mode, AI calls stubbed for predictable results

**Current Test Structure**:
```
/tests
  helpers/
    ports.ts          # Find free TCP port
    server.ts         # Spawn & health-check backend
  backend/
    health.test.ts    # Boot backend → GET /health → expect 200
    auth.test.ts      # REST auth: 401 without token, 200 with Bearer
    ws.test.ts        # WS handshake: join → expect "joined" ack
    ws-chat.test.ts   # WS chat event → verify persisted via REST
    ai-router.test.ts # Unit: stub fetch → routeChat() adds assistant msg
    trial-limit.test.ts # Seed counter → assert "Trial Limit Reached"
```

### Phase 10: Multimodal Attachments & Document Processing (Complete ✅)
**Date**: 2025-06-15
Implemented a comprehensive attachment system, enabling multimodal conversations with support for images and documents.

**Backend Implementation**:
- **File Upload Endpoint**: New `/api/upload` endpoint using `multer` for secure, authenticated file uploads to a local `/uploads` directory. Includes a 10MB file size limit.
- **Static File Serving**: Express server configured to serve uploaded files statically from the `/uploads` path.
- **Document Processing Service**: Created `document-processor.ts` using `pdf-parse` (for PDFs) and `mammoth` (for DOCX files) to extract text content from documents on the backend.

**Frontend UI Enhancements**:
- **Unified Attachment Button**: Replaced the previous photo icon with a universal paperclip icon in `ChatInputArea.tsx`.
- **Attachment Menu & Input**: A clean dropdown menu provides an "Upload a file" option, which opens a file dialog accepting `image/*`, `.pdf`, `.doc`, and `.docx`.
- **Instant Previews**: Implemented an instant, client-side preview system.
  - Image thumbnails are generated using `URL.createObjectURL()`.
  - Documents get a placeholder tile with an icon representing the file type (PDF/DOC).
- **Attachment Management**: Previews appear below the textarea and include a loading spinner during upload and an "X" button for removal.
- **Paste Functionality**: Users can now paste images directly from their clipboard into the chat input area.

**Multimodal AI Integration**:
- **Base64 Image Encoding**: Images are converted to Base64 on the client-side using `FileReader` to be sent directly to vision-enabled AI models.
- **Enhanced WebSocket Payload**: The message format now includes an `attachments` array, carrying metadata and Base64 data for images.
- **Intelligent AI Router (`ai-router.ts`)**: The backend router was upgraded to handle multimodal content.
  - **Vision Support**: For images, it formats the content into the `image_url` structure required by models like GPT-4o and the `inlineData` structure for Google Gemini.
  - **Document Text Extraction**: For documents, it calls the `document-processor` and appends the extracted text to the user's message, allowing the AI to "read" the document's content.
- **Clean Message Sending**: The `sendWithAttachments` function now bundles the text content and attachment data together upon sending, without cluttering the textarea with markdown.

**User Experience Improvements**:
- **Inline Image Rendering**: User and assistant messages containing images now render them directly in the chat flow using ReactMarkdown.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The user's text input remains clean, as attachment handling is managed in the background and through the preview UI.
- **Resource Management**: Implemented proper cleanup for `URL.createObjectURL()` to prevent memory leaks.
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved a critical rendering bug where ReactMarkdown received an `[object Object]` instead of a string, by ensuring message content passed to the component is always a string and providing a custom image renderer.
